## Features
### Will Valour have a Voice Chat?
It is not planned to have a voice chat until a viable product has released and funding has been received.
#### *Why couldn't you just make people host the voice chats locally?*
Local hosting would not be secure for people as the person hosting it could steal their data. Even if it was encrypted, Valour would have to process and proxy it which would cost money.
### What are planets and systems?
Planets are where your community will be on. There will be chat rooms and categories. Systems are an optional collection of planets. They would be primarily used for large communities or with many separate different sub-communities. For example, a nation roleplay where is multiple nations. Each nation would have its planet and they would be all in the one system for their roleplay.
#### *How will Systems and Planets be organized?*
System roles would be applied to every planet within the system. This would also apply the permission the system user has onto the planet and planets would have their roles as well. This means if someone was a system admin they would also be an admin on planets within the system almost acting like planets within a single planet.
## Valour App
