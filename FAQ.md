# Valour Frequently Asked Questions

## How can I help?
You can support Valour on our [patreon](https://www.patreon.com/valourapp)!
In the future, we will also have a gofundme for initial funding such as legal advice, infrastructure and voice chat support.
## I have an issue/suggestion!
If you have a issues/suggestions it is recommended you use the [Valour Github Issues](https://github.com/Vooper-Media-LLC/Valour/issues) but before submitting any issue it is advised you also check the [Development Board](https://github.com/SpikeViper/Valour/projects/1) for suggestions and [Bug Triage Board](https://github.com/SpikeViper/Valour/projects/2) for bug issues.
## Will Valour have a Voice Chat?
It is not planned to have a voice chat due to the high cost of hosting until there is a viable product and the funding.
### *Why couldn't you just make people host the voice chats locally?*
Local hosting would not be secure for people as the person hosting it could steal their data. Even if it was encrypted, Valour would have to process and proxy it which would cost money.
## I have a SpookVooper account, will I have to make a Valour account?
Yes, they will be migrated.
## Will Valour have a mobile version?
Valour will eventually have a mobile version on App Store and Play Store but as of now there is mobile support on the web if you do want to use it.
## I want an app on a Phone/PC!
There are options to make websites to be like apps on browsers like Chrome/Edge for phones and computers.
## Is there going to be a Linux version?
Linux version will be developed once a viable product is achieved. Until then Linux users can use the browser app.
## Is there anything I have to worry about if I make something for Valour?
Due to Valour's AGPL3 license, you can modify or use Valour however you want however it must be opensource. For more info visit [LICENSE](https://github.com/SpikeViper/Valour/blob/main/LICENSE). It is also required to have you have signed commits when working on Valour itself which you can find documentation on [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/managing-commit-signature-verification).
## What are planets and systems?
Planets are where your community will be on. There will be chat rooms and categories. Systems are an optional collection of planets. They would be primarily used for large communities or with many separate different sub-communities. For example, a nation roleplay where is multiple nations. Each nation would have its planet and they would be all in the one system for their roleplay.
## How will Systems and Planets be organized?
System roles would be applied to every planet within the system. This would also apply the permission the system user has onto the planet and planets would have their roles as well. This means if someone was a system admin they would also be an admin on planets within the system almost acting like planets within a single planet.
## Will there be custom themes for planets?
You will be able to customize your planets with different themes. It is most likely going to be custom CSS but it might change in the future.
## Will there be bots/automated accounts?
Yes, there will be bots. You can use your account for self-botting as well if you wish.
## Can I have sub-categories?
Yes, you can have as many as you want on your planet.
## How will Valour be monetized?
In the future, Valour will be monetized using a subscription for communities and possibly one for specific users as well.
## How will Valour handle user reports?
Valour will prioritize user reports that break the law such as doxxing, illegal material, extortion, etc... We will also need to confirm if a user did send certain messages if required to confirm a report. However, Valour will not punish people for being offensive and only assure safety and law.
